# EasyBroker Client

Using the programming language of your choice, create a class that consumes the EasyBroker API to read all the properties of our staging account and print their titles. Include at least one unit test and send us your code as a gist.

Staging account documentation and credentials are available at: https://dev.easybroker.com/docs.
